# Frontend Mentor - Skilled e-learning landing page

![Design preview for the Skilled e-learning landing page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to challenge, using flexbox,grid and media queries.

## The challenge

challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## What I learnt

- well this was my first responsive project so learnt about media queries
- grinded a lot on background images and backgrounds-linear gradient, cause I couldnt work out how to use both of them on same element for a solid amount of time.
  **Have fun building!** ðŸš€
